This is the motion detection logic of this app using OpenCV. 
This code captures video from a source, applies some preprocessing steps like converting frames to grayscale, Gaussian blurring, and finding contours to detect motion in the video feed. 
Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. Captures video from a source, presumably a webcam or a video file.

    -   url = get_droidcam_url()
        video = cv2.VideoCapture(url)
    
    . get_droidcam_url():   This function seems to retrieve the URL for streaming video from some source, likely DroidCam, 
                            which is an application that allows using a smartphone camera as a webcam.

    . cv2.VideoCapture(url):    This function initializes a video capture object. 
                                It takes the URL or the device index (typically 0 for the default webcam) as an argument and returns a video capture object.
        . Arguments:
            - url:  This is the argument passed to VideoCapture() which specifies the source of the video. 
                    In this case, it is a URL obtained from the function get_droidcam_url()


2. Preprocesses each frame:

    . Converts the frame to grayscale.

        -   gray_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        
        . cv2.cvtColor():   This function converts an image from one color space to another. 
                            Here, it converts the frame from BGR (Blue, Green, Red) to grayscale.

        . Arguments:
            - frame:    This is the input image/frame that we want to convert to grayscale.
            - cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY:   This argument specifies the conversion code, 
                                    indicating that we want to convert the input frame from the BGR (Blue-Green-Red) color space to grayscale.
    
    . Applies Gaussian blur to the grayscale frame to reduce noise.

        -   gray_frame_gau_blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray_frame, (21, 21), 0)

        . cv2.GaussianBlur():   This function applies Gaussian blur to the image to reduce noise and detail. 
                                It takes the grayscale frame and a kernel size (in this case, 21x21) as arguments. The kernel size must be an odd number.

        . Arguments:
            - gray_frame:   This is the input image to be blurred, which in this case is the grayscale frame.
            - (21, 21): This tuple specifies the width and height of the Gaussian kernel. 
                        It determines the size of the area over which the blur is applied. Here, it's (21, 21), indicating a 21x21 kernel size.
            - 0:    This represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel in the X direction. 
                    When set to 0, OpenCV automatically calculates the standard deviation based on the kernel size provided. 
                    If we set it to a positive value, it specifies the standard deviation explicitly.
    

3. Initializes first_frame to the first frame of the video. This frame will be used as a reference to detect motion.

    -   if first_frame is None:
            first_frame = gray_frame_gau_blurred

    . This condition checks if the first_frame variable is None. If it is, it assigns the current processed frame to first_frame. 
      This sets the baseline frame for motion detection.


4. Computes the absolute difference between the current frame and the first_frame.

    -   delta_frame = cv2.absdiff(first_frame, gray_frame_gau_blurred)

    . cv2.absdiff():    This function computes the absolute difference between two frames.
                        In this case, between the first_frame and the current processed frame. It helps highlight the areas where there is a significant change compared to the baseline frame.

    . Arguments:
        - first_frame:  This variable holds the first frame captured from the video source. 
                        It serves as the reference frame against which subsequent frames are compared to detect changes or motion.
        - gray_frame_gau_blurred:   This variable holds the current frame after applying Gaussian blur and converting it to grayscale. 
                                    Gaussian blur is applied to reduce noise and smooth out the image, making it easier to detect meaningful changes. Converting the frame to grayscale simplifies the comparison process by reducing the dimensionality of the image from three channels (RGB) to one channel (grayscale).


5. Thresholds the delta frame to create a binary image where motion areas are highlighted.

    -   thresh_frame = cv2.threshold(delta_frame, 60, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]

    . cv2.threshold():  This function applies a fixed-level threshold to each pixel in the image. 
                        It converts the delta frame into a binary image, where pixels with intensity greater than 60 are set to 255 (white) and others to 0 (black). This helps in isolating the regions of significant change.

    . Arguments:
        - delta_frame:  The input image on which the threshold will be applied. 
                        In this case, delta_frame is the absolute difference between the current frame and the first_frame, highlighting areas of significant change.
        - 60:   The threshold value. Pixels with values greater than this threshold will be set to the maximum value (in this case, 255), 
                while pixels with values less than or equal to the threshold will be set to 0.
        - 255:  The maximum value that pixels can take after applying the threshold. In this case, it's set to 255, which corresponds to white.
        - cv2.THRESH_BINARY:    The type of thresholding. It indicates that the thresholding operation should be binary, 
                                meaning that pixels with values above the threshold become white (255) and those below become black (0).


6. Dilates the thresholded image to fill gaps and holes in the detected objects.

    -   dilated_frame = cv2.dilate(thresh_frame, None, iterations=2)

    . cv2.dilate(): This function performs morphological dilation on the thresholded image. 
                    It helps to merge nearby white pixels and expand the white regions in the image. The iterations parameter controls the number of times dilation is applied.

    . Arguments:
        - thresh_frame: This is the input binary image on which dilation is to be performed. 
                        It's typically the output of a thresholding operation where pixels with intensity values above a certain threshold are set to white (255) and others to black (0).
        - None (structuring element):   In this case, since None is passed, a default rectangular structuring element of size 3x3 is used.
        - iterations=2: This parameter determines how many times the dilation operation is applied to the image. 
                        In this code, it's set to 2, meaning that the dilation operation is applied twice.


7. Finds contours in the dilated image.

    -   econtours, check = cv2.findContours(dilated_frame, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    . cv2.findContours():   This function finds contours in a binary image. 
                            It takes the thresholded and dilated frame as input and returns a list of contours.

    . Arguments:
        - dilated_frame:    The binary image in which contours are to be found. 
                            It typically represents the result of thresholding and dilation operations.
        - cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL:    This parameter specifies the retrieval mode for contours. 
                                RETR_EXTERNAL retrieves only the external contours, meaning it ignores contours within other contours.
        - cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE:  This parameter specifies the contour approximation method. 
                                    CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE compresses horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments and leaves only their end points. 
                                    This helps in saving memory by removing redundant points.


8. Filters contours based on their area. Contours with an area smaller than 5000 pixels are discarded as noise.
   Draws bounding rectangles around significant contours on the original frame.

    -   for contour in contours:
            if cv2.contourArea(contour) < 5000:
                continue
            else:
                x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
                cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    . This loop iterates over each contour found in the frame.

    . cv2.contourArea(contour): This function calculates the area of the contour. 
                                Contours with an area smaller than 5000 pixels are considered noise and are skipped.
        . Arguments:
            - contour:  This argument is a single contour represented as a numpy array. 
                        Contours are lists of points that describe the boundary of an object in an image.

    . cv2.boundingRect(contour):    This function calculates the bounding rectangle for the contour. 
                                    It returns the coordinates (x, y) of the top-left corner and the width (w) and height (h) of the rectangle.
        . Arguments:
            - contour:  This argument is a single contour represented as a numpy array. 
                        Contours are lists of points that describe the boundary of an object in an image.

    . cv2.rectangle():  This function draws a rectangle around the detected object in the original frame. 
                        The color of the rectangle is set to green (0, 255, 0), and the thickness is set to 2 pixels.
        . Arguments:
            - frame:    This is the image (frame) on which the rectangle will be drawn. It's the original frame retrieved from the video capture.
            - (x, y):   These are the coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle. 
                        They represent the position of the bounding box around the detected object.
            - (x+w, y+h):   These are the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the rectangle.
                            They are calculated based on the width (w) and height (h) of the bounding box.
            - (0, 255, 0):  This tuple specifies the color of the rectangle in BGR format. Here, it represents green color since it's (0, 255, 0). 
                            The first value corresponds to the intensity of blue, the second to green, and the third to red.
            - 2:    This parameter specifies the thickness of the rectangle's outline. 
                    It's set to 2, so the rectangle will be drawn with a thickness of 2 pixels.


9. Displays the original frame with bounding rectangles drawn around detected motion areas.

    -   cv2.imshow("Video Captured", frame)

    . cv2.imshow(): This function displays an image in a window.
                    Here, it displays the original frame with bounding rectangles drawn around detected motion areas. 
                    The window is named "Video Captured".

    . Arguments:
        - "Video Captured": This is the title of the window where the image will be displayed.
                            It's just a string that acts as the window title. In this case, the window will be titled "Video Captured".
        - frame:    This is the image or frame that we want to display. 
                    It's the original frame captured from the video source (webcam, file, etc.) with any modifications applied to it (e.g., drawing rectangles around detected motion areas).


10. Checks for the 'q' key press to exit the loop.

    -   key = cv2.waitKey(1)
            if key == ord('q'):
                break
    
    . cv2.waitKey():    This function waits for a key event for a specified amount of time (1 millisecond in this case). 
                        If a key is pressed during this time, it returns the ASCII value of the key.
        . Arguments:
            - 1:    This argument specifies the delay in milliseconds. 
                    In this case, 1 indicates that cv2.waitKey will wait for 1 millisecond for a key event. 
                    If a key is pressed during this time, it will return the ASCII value of that key. If no key is pressed, it returns -1.

    . ord('q'): This function returns the ASCII value of the character 'q'. 
                If the 'q' key is pressed, the loop breaks, and the program exits.
        . Arguments:
            - 'q':  In this context, 'q' is a character literal representing the lowercase letter 'q'.


11. Releases Resources.

    -   video.release()
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    . video.release():  This function releases the video capture object and frees up any associated resources.
                        When we're done working with a video capture object, it's essential to release it to free up system resources. 
                        Releasing it ensures that the camera or video file is closed properly.

    . cv2.destroyAllWindows():  This function closes all OpenCV windows that were created using functions like cv2.imshow().
                                When we're finished displaying images or videos and we want to close all the OpenCV windows, we use cv2.destroyAllWindows().
